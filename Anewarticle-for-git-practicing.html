<h1> Humanity Does Matter </h1>

<p>
The poverty cycle is perpetuated when poorer communities lack skills, and in turn, they have limited earning potential. This cycle leads to malnutrition, and social problems.

Humanity First established its Learn a Skill programme to provide cheap or heavily subsidised vocational training to the most vulnerable people in the world.

HF is running 17 IT Institutes providing diploma and certificate level training to students in Microsoft Office, Networking, the Internet, Desktop management and even programming. HF is now able to offer MCSE accredited training in Africa. IT Centres are operational in The Gambia, Sierra Leone, Indonesia, Guyana, Kosovo, Benin, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Mali, Nigeria, Uganda and Niger. So far, just over 20,000 students have graduated, and in some regions, the local civil service has started mandating a HF certificate in IT for new recruits. The centres have been popular with both men and women.

HF is running 6 Sewing Skills centres in Burkina Faso, Mali, Sierra Leone and Benin. This is most popular with women who are taught basic sewing, advanced tailoring and embroidery. Students either go on to work in factories, or establish their own tailoring business from home. Some are even establishing their own boutiques and are considering foreign export of their goods!

HF have established the Our Kids, Our Future initiative in the US to serve the poorest city areas of the US through the provision of books and teaching aids, academic awards, schools supplies and even preventative health services in collaboration with the local communities.
